# Pair Up!

A simple flask app for allocating student pairs in the [CITS3403 project](http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS3403/index.php?fname=projects&project=yes).

## Getting Started

Activate the python virtual environment:
`$source virtual-environment/bin/activate`

To run the app:
`$flask run`

To stop the app:
`$^C`

To exit the environment:
`$deactivate`

### Prerequisites

Requires python3, flask, venv, ....

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

Install python3. I'm not sure at this stage how much of the virtual environment is serialized and wrapped up in venv. Hopefully all of it.

set virtual environment
`source virtual-environment/bin/activate`

`pip install flask`

`flask run`
